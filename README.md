##### What is this?

Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio, make learning a Habit. Every month members of the group will conduct workshops, have mini hack projects, present short and sweet presentations on a coding technique, third party library, new language, design methodology, etc. This will be mixed with articles, books or tools that the group ran across. **Very informal**

##### Whats with the name Pico?

<Count Giovanni Pico Della Mirandola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Pico_della_Mirandola) (1463-1494), Count Pico was an Italian humanist and philosopher during the Renaissance whose motto, Deomni re scibili *Of all things that one can know*, asserted that he knew all there was to be known. De omni re scibili should be the motto of all Pragmatic Programmers.
