jquery selects elements based on data attributes, rather than classes. Classes are for designers, who can rename them, or reorganize them. Behavior is linked to data attributes.


 

selector ='[data-behavior=~=expandable]'
expandSelector = '{selector}[data-behavior~=expand_on_click]'
$(document).on ('click', expandSelector, (event) -> 

)
