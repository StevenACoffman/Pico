Problem: Too much manual, repetitive process work (intelectual drudgery)
Solution: Preferential Option for Reducing Support Burden

New Support / Tech Team Process:
Ticket Recieved
Analyze how we could make it so no similar ticket is ever recieved, unless exceptional circumstances
Improve Documentation (end user or developer)
Microproject
 
Microproject types:
Automating Manual Repetitive Tasks
Empower Users to meet their own needs*
Make Apps Self-Maintaining (e.g. no manual yearly setups)
End User Documentation Improvements

* Give users the ability to do anything. If they mess up, they can fix it themselves

Microproject Source:
Rotating members
Permanent support members
Outside BA
Leads / Architect

Barriers:
Too big to complete in short time (rotation, day, etc.)
Not familiar enough with patterns to know what is repepetive
Technology is often ancient
Public End user documentation is sometimes lacking
Fire Drill mentality
