SallyAnn Freudenberg - Top Pairing tips

- Find the physical set-up that works for you - think about what you are losing / gaining and work out how to best compensate.
- Take breaks. Have quiet time. Stop talking for a while if it's tricky.
- Navigator - don't correct to soon.
- Work together on most aspects, stay focused.
- Driving is cognitively tiring - change roles, regularly.
- Don't be afraid to let go of the keyboard and (e.g. ) draw or make lists.
- Speak at such a level that others can 'tune in', but not so loud that they're unable to 'tune out'.
