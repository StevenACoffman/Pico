# SnackLog by Andy Vella (name by John Schultz)
## Bite Sized Value
### Staying Lean with a Healthy Snacklog

## A subset of your product backlog

### Just like any other backlog item, but smaller. Healthy snacks...
* Have value
* Are independent
* Can quickly move through your entire workflow

### Why a Snacklog?
* Provides opportunity to build value in-between larger stories
* Gives the team greater sense of ownership
* Surprise and delight customers (technical or business) with tiny wins
* It's such a cool name

### How to Snack
* Encourage participation from full team
* Don’t overthink it... grooming and prioritization may never be necessary
* Create some separation from the product backlog
* Pull, don’t push
* Remember: over-snacking can spoil your appetite
