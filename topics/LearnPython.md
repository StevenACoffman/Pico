# Learning Python
### From [Stack Overflow here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru/2576240#2576240):
I thought the process of Python mastery went something like:

1. Discover [list comprehensions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension#Python)
2. Discover [generators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Generators)
3. Incorporate [map, reduce, filter, iter, range, xrange often into your code](http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html)
4. Discover [Decorators](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators)
5. Write recursive functions, a lot
6. Discover [itertools](http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html) and [functools](http://docs.python.org/library/functools.html)
7. Read [Real World Haskell](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596514980) ([read free online](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/))
8. Rewrite all your old Python code with tons of higher order functions, recursion, and whatnot.
9. Annoy your cubicle mates every time they present you with a Python class. Claim it could be "better" implemented as a dictionary plus some functions. Embrace functional programming.
10. Rediscover the [Strategy pattern](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Science_Design_Patterns/Strategy#Python) and then [all those things](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596007124) from imperative code you tried so hard to forget after Haskell.
11. Find a balance.

Note: [Dive Into Python]() gets you 1,2,3, and 4
