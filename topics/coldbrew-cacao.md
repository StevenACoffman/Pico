Cold-brew cacao

Ingredients:
# 6 ounces (170 grams, or about 1 1/2 cups) of roasted cacao nibs
# ½ gallon of cold water

Directions:

1. Grind your nibs using a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle to a texture that’s fine but not powdery. (Don’t put cacao beans in your expensive burr coffee grinder; the fat will gum it up.)
2. Line the pitcher with a nut-milk bag and dump the cacao grounds inside.
3. Fill the bag-lined pitcher with cold water, and stir to make sure to get all the grounds wet.
4. Cinch the bag, cover the pitcher, and leave it at room temperature for about 16 hours. If your home is very hot, put it in the refrigerator, but add a few hours to your brew time. (It will grow increasingly cloudy and robust in flavor as it brews.)
5. Remove the nut-milk bag and squeeze all the liquid into your pitcher. (Use the grounds for mulch if you have a garden!)
6. Stir before serving, as cacao particles will settle toward the bottom.
7. Enjoy over ice, straight or with your favorite kind of milk.
